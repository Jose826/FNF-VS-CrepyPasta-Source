mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, so dont add stuff like other mods, i just made this functional for the fanmades of THIS mod

dont add other mods beacuse you know, gonna be buggy some crashes and stuff(maybe im fixing this on a future ;) )

and dont add any dificulty, just add the normal

icons: winning frames are optional, i added a thing that makes that actually just 2 frames works

if you put on a .json stage "isPixelStage": true, the cam note movement dont gonna work

you dont need to add note camera movement script, is already on the game

dont delete the .lua file named modcharts.lua on script folder
